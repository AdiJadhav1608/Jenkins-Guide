# 🚀 Jenkins Build Triggers

Build Triggers define **WHEN** a Jenkins job should run.  
They help automate builds without manual intervention.

## 🔑 What are Build Triggers?

Build Triggers allow Jenkins to start a job based on:

• Time-based schedules  
• Source code changes  
• External events  
• Manual actions
