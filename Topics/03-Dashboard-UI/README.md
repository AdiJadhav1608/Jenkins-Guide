# 🖥️ Jenkins — Dashboard & User Interface (Day 3)

---

## 🎯 Objective
This section explains the **Jenkins Dashboard** and its **User Interface components** so you can confidently navigate Jenkins and understand what happens during builds.

You will learn:
- Jenkins Dashboard layout
- Job & build visibility
- Console output
- Workspace and logs

---

## 🏠 Jenkins Dashboard Overview
The Jenkins Dashboard is the **main landing page** after login.  
It provides a **central view** of all jobs, build status, and system options.

### 🔹 What you see on the Dashboard:
- 📂 List of Jenkins jobs
- 🟢🟡🔴 Build status indicators
- ⏱️ Last build time
- 🔢 Build number
- 📜 Quick access to job pages

---

## 📊 Build Status Indicators
| Color | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| 🟢 Blue | Build successful |
| 🔴 Red | Build failed |
| 🟡 Yellow | Unstable build |
| ⚪ Grey | Build not run |

---

## 📁 Job Page Components
When you click a job, you will see:

### 🔹 Build History
- Shows all previous builds
- Helps track failures and fixes

### 🔹 Workspace
- Contains checked-out source code
- Files generated during build

### 🔹 Console Output
- Real-time build logs
- Most important place for debugging ❗

## 📜 Console Output (Very Important)
Console Output shows:
- SCM checkout logs
- Build commands executed
- Errors and failure reasons

✅ **Tip:** Always check console output first when a build fails.
